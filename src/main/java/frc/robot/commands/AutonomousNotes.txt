We should be able to start our robot from anywhere on the Robot Starting Line. This means depending on our Alliance members we could give the robot a straight shot to the reef.
It's about 88" to the reef from the starting line. There are several ways we could program our autonomous w/o AprilTags:

Straight shot to coral:
    DriveSubsystem.goToSetpointCommand(x);
    ChangeElevatorLevel(2 or 3, if we want more points);
    AdvanceCoral().withTimeout(x); // decide on # of seconds for coral to launch

If we need to reach the pipes that are not directly opposite the starting line, we could do it with only three movement commands:

Coral is on another side:
    DriveSubsystem.goToSetpointCommand(x);
    DriveSubsystem.goToRotateCommand(x);
    DriveSubsystem.goToSetpointCommand(y);
    ChangeElevatorLevel(2 or 3);
    AdvanceCoral().withTimeout(x);

Autonomous is only 15 seconds long, meaning that it would be prohibitive to try to score more coral (probably). We could try to position the robot near the coral station
to get a faster start in teleop.

Just going a set distance to leave the start line:
    DriveSubsystem.goToSetpointCommand(x);
