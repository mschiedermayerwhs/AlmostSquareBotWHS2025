How the button bindings for the controller are currently set up:
    Left and right joysticks: TankDrive (right controller - all other controls are on the left USB controller)
    AXBY buttons: SetElevatorHeight for levels 0/1/2/3 (L1/2/3/4)
    START button: Run the CoralChute, with an auto backspin at trough level
    Left and right triggers: Controlling the Algae arm (cycle through low/mid/high positions)
    Left and right bumpers: Controlling the Ball Grabbing motor (one is +, other -, constant speed)

The default command for the DriveSubsystem is TankDrive using the joysticks.

All Can IDs should be set up and labeled correctly.
