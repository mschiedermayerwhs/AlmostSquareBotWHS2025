How the button bindings for the controller are currently set up:
    Left and right joysticks: TankDrive
    AXBY buttons: SetElevatorHeight for levels 0/1/2/3
    START button: Run the CoralChute, with an auto backspin at trough level
    Left and right triggers: Controlling the Algae arm (difference taken, left=+, right=-)
    Left and right bumpers: Controlling the Ball Grabbing motor (one is +, other -, constant speed)
*   BACK button: Slowly raise the elevator, use to determine encoder position

The default command for the DriveSubsystem is TankDrive using the joysticks.
The default command for the AlgaeGrabber is RunAlgaeArmMotor using the triggers. (set up similarly to joysticks, w/o slew rate limiter)

Right now, the elevators and tank drive are the only parts of the code that are connected to their subsystems; CoralChute/AlgaeGrabber are not set up, no CAN IDs, all bindings commented out.

3/4 NEW TESTING:
BACK button: Run elevator UP
START button: Run elevator DOWN
